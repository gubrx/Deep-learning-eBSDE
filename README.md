# README for 'Deep learning for forward utilities using ergodic BSDEs'

## Abstract
In this repository, we present the code and solvers associated to the paper 'Deep learning for forward utilities using ergodic BSDEs'.

## Content
The SolverseBSDE.py file contains two solvers :
- GeBSDE, optimized global loss function at the terminal random time
- LAeBSDE, optimized according to the agregation of local loss functions up to the greater return time on the train set.

Run the maineBSDE file and choose parameters and which example to run.
